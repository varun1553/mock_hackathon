      <p>A non-government organization (NGO) is an organization that generally is formed independent from government. They are typically nonprofit entities, and many of them are active in humanitarianism or the social sciences; they can also include clubs and associations that provide services to their members and others. Surveys indicate that NGOs have a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.However, NGOs can also be lobby groups for corporations, such as the World Economic Forum.NGOs are classified by  orientationâ€”the type of activities an NGO undertakes, such as activities involving human rights, consumer protection, environmentalism, health, or development; and level of operation, which indicates the scale at which an organization works: local, regional, national, or international.</p>
